Mahdi Nasri - Personal Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm Mahdi Nasri, a passionate Software Development Instructor and web developer, proficient in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I built this project to showcase my skills, projects, and experience in web development.

About This Portfolio
This portfolio is a single-page web application built using React.js, demonstrating my expertise in front-end and back-end technologies. It includes sections about me, my skills, previous work, and contact information. I am continuously adding animations, responsive designs, and other features to make the experience more engaging.

Key Features
Responsive Design: The portfolio adapts to different screen sizes, offering a seamless experience across devices.
Animations on Scroll: Interactive animations triggered as users scroll through the sections.
Modal-based Navigation: A smooth, responsive menu that displays on small screens.
Dynamic Content: Each section of the portfolio is dynamically rendered to provide a rich user experience.
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands to explore and modify the app:

npm start
This command starts the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page reloads automatically as you make changes, and you can view lint errors in the console.

npm run build
This builds the portfolio app for production and optimizes it for performance. The production build is stored in the build folder and is ready to be deployed.

Deployment
I have deployed this portfolio on [GitHub Pages] (or other deployment service if needed). You can easily deploy the app to any static hosting service or cloud provider.

I am also the founder and lead developer of Taqwira, a football reservation platform.
